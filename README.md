# SQL_Employee_Data_
# Introduction
Learning to work with data using SQL has been a fascinating experience. In this repository, I have documented a task from an employee dataset I sourced and downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset contains details about employees from 3 different cities (Bangalore, New Delhi and Pune) and it has 9 columns with thousands of rows.These columns includes employee Education, Joining year, City, Gender, Experience, Payment tier, Leave and Age. The dataset is sampled in the image below.

# Activity
After a moment of getting familiar with the dataset, I checked to see if the dataset has any duplicate values. The code, SELECT DISTINCT (*) FROM EMPLOYEE; was used and it showed that the dataset contained some duplicate values. Also, I coined out some questions that could be answered from the dataset. The following part of this repository contains the questions and actvities carried out in this task.
1. Select the Employee table to show the data where city is Pune and age is between 32 and 40.
